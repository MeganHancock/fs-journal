# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern
01. What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
  
  > | The pillars of OOP are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. |

02. How does `export` differ from `export default`?
  
  > | 'Export default' moves a single value from one file to another, while export is used for multiple values or whole files. |

03. What is Encapsulation?
  
  > | Encapsulation is the bundling of data and the methods that act on that data such that access to that data is restricted from outside the bundle. MVC is a process to encapsulate and protect data. |

04. What are some of the benefits of the `Proxy` object that we are using in our structure for applications?
  
  > | Proxy objects allow further security and encapsulation by aliasing data and throwing errors when the original data is attempted to be accessed.|

05. What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
  
  > | A class is a blueprint for creating objects where a class instance, and the instance is the object itself|

06. What is a computed Property?
  
  > | Computed properties are object properties that are created using an expression in square brackets. |

07. What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
  
  > | The purpose of the MVC pattern is to separate your code into different files for organization and for security. |

08. What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
  
  > | The 'controller' handles user input and communicates directly and draws to the 'view' (DOM). |

09. What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
  
  > | The 'service' is the file that affects and manipulates data. |

10. What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
  
  > | The 'model' handles data representation. |
