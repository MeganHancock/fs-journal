# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > | Synchronous code runs from top to bottom in the order that its read without stopping, while asynchronous code will wait until the current line of code is completed before moving on. |

02. What is an event listener?

  > | An event listener is a function that waits for something to effect a keyword or action/ event that it is focused on. |

03. What does *REST* stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

  > | Representational State Transfer .. REST is a design pattern for APIs. It has created universal standards for APIs to ensure they are uniform in structure and easy to use.|

04. What is a callback / higher order function?

  > | A callback function is one that is called within another function. A function that is passed as an argument to to another function to be completed within that second function. |

05. What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

  > |A promise is an asynchronous object that will eventually complete or fail an operation. catch() will run alternative code when a promise is failed/ unresolved. |

06. Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

  > | Get, Put, and Post |

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?

  > | Application Programming Interface |

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > | Make the function 'async' to 'await' a promise response.|

09. What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

  > | Encapsulation is a way of organizing data and abstracting data so as to secure it and prevent  access to it. |

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

  > | 200 OK |

11. What is a 400 error?

  > | Bad Request |
