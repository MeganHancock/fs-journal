# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > | We use Git to track content and store it locally and in a remote repository, work parallel with other developers, and maintain a history of code changes and updates. |

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > | Make Directory - creates a new folder within the CLI|

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > | A pseudo-class is a CSS that is called/activated in the event of an action made by the user. button:hover|

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > | Specificity indicates which CSS selector(s) carry more weight in comparison to others. If a selector has a higher specificity it will override a rule that has lower specificity. I think it will be beneficial because it will help keep CSS rules from getting to disorganized, and also useful to to be able to apply a variety of rules to properties. |

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > | !important is a style declaration that overrides every other styling rule. Over-utilization might slow down the page loading and potentially unintentionally override styling rules you want to keep. I'd imagine !important declarations don't work very well together. |

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```
       > |The three properties as shown in the example are: h1 - Selector; color - Property; rgba - Value |

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > | An accessible design enables folks to easily visually process the message you are trying to convey. Design can illicit the reaction or emotion you are trying to achieve upon first impression, before the user has had to chance to consume the content. |

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > | Wireframing allows you to sketch a rough draft of what you are planning to code. |

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > | Wireframes are valuable because it seems it takes a little bit of time at the beginning  |

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > | Flex is a display property that allows you to manipulate the position of the direct children of the element it is applied to. |

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > | Margin, border, and padding are the components of the box model that affect it's size. |
